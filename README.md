# MY JOB TRACKR


## an app for keeping track of the job application process
### created by Devin Hinzo

The inspiration behind this app stemmed from wanting to focus and organize my job search as I break into the tech field as a software engineer.
I am notorious for getting distracted, starting projects, and losing tab of where I leave those projects, creating a cycle of inefficiency. Through my time in General Assembly's Software Engineer Immersive course, I addressed flaws in my study and work habits and I wanted to create an app to show myself how far I've come. Access the app on Heroku [here](https://myjobtrackr-app.herokuapp.com)

My Job Trackr is a kanban board-style app that allows users to: 
* register and gain access to a personal dashboard
* add jobs to which they'll apply
* see their jobs as cards organized in three columns:
  * Unregistered
  * In Progress
  * Completed
* drag and drop individual cards as they progress through the job search process
* view job app-specific information, such as location, position, link, and notes
* edit and delete jobs at any point in the process

## Technologies Used

* Python/Flask micro web framework
* React
* Altassian's [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) library for drag n drop functionality
